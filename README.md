# landing-page

Thanks for stopping by! If you're here, it means you're interested in knowing what goes on under the hood of my landing page.

Why did I do this?

Well, as you can see, I like making characters in FF14. But when you have a lot of characters, it gets confusing trying to organize them all. If I wanted to reference another character, I had to hunt down their carrd and link them manually. Not anymore! Now I have a handy-dandy page that acts as a hub for all of my toons.

What did I use?

I used HTML and CSS for the actual building of the side, and Javascript for the sliding page animations.

This is a fully functional landing page that I plan on keeping up to date should any information change, or even if I need to add new characters! If I play other MMOs and I need a place to hold those characters as well, I will consider using this website as a catch-all for all of my OCs. As of right now, this will stay FF14 centric.

I appreciate any feedback on either the site's design or code.
