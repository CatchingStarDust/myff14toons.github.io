# landing-page
Thanks for stopping by! If you're here, it means you're interested in knowing what goes on under the hood of my landing page.

Why did I do this? Well, as you can see, I like making characters in FF14. Some would say I have too many of them. But as it goes, when you have a lot of characters, it gets confusing trying to organize them all. If I wanted to reference another character I had, I had to hunt down their carrd and link them manually. Well! Not anymore! Now i have a handy-dandy page that acts as a hub for all of my toons.

The code isn't anything complicated. I used HTML and CSS for the actual building of the side. I'm quite proud of those slanted cards. And I used Javascript for that cute animation of each blurb opening and closing. 

This is a fully functional landing page that I plan on keeping up to date should any information change, or even if I need to add new characters! If I play other MMOs and I need a place to hold those characters as well, I will consider using this website as a catch-all for all of my OCs. As of right now, this will stay  FF14 centric.

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any feedback on either the page's design or code.
